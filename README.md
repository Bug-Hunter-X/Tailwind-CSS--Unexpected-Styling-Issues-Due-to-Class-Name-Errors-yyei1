# Tailwind CSS: Unexpected Styling Issues Due to Class Name Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS that can be difficult to identify. The bug arises from misspelled or incorrectly used class names.

## Description

The `MyComponent.jsx` file contains a simple component that uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, if a class name is misspelled or does not exist in the Tailwind CSS configuration, the styling may not apply correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the component is not styled as expected if there is a typo in class names or if the Tailwind CSS configuration is incorrect.

## Solution

The `solution.jsx` file provides a corrected version of the code where the class names are correctly spelled.  Thorough checking of class names using a linter and careful attention to detail when writing Tailwind CSS classes are crucial to avoiding this issue.

Ensure your Tailwind configuration file (usually `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) is correctly configured and that all referenced class names are defined within it.
